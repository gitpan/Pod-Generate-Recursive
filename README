Pod-Generate-Recursive

If you've ever come across a code base and wanted to easily generate
POD from the source then you've probably written a small script to 
do it for you. You no longer need to do it and can instead point this
code at you source and have it generate POD from .pl and .pm files.
Enjoy!
